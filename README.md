## Moved to GitLab

## Original description

CDML Loader is a collection of helper classes and annotations to help you organise your CDM application.
It separates the layout creation and controller code from each other by using a dedicated file for
the layout definition, written in a markup language called CDML, an XML document validated against the CDML DTD.

Requires CDM version `0.4.0` or later, compatibility with other versions is not guaranteed.

*This documentation is NOT complete and you shouldn't rely on it. This project has not been released as
any stable release, beta or alpha, so anything might change. The demo application in the source code is a great reference
when you can't find how to do something in the documentation below. (src/main/java/nl/jochembroekhoff/cdmlloaderdemo/)*
